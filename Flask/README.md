This is used to explore Flask stuff.

To create a separate python environment for the exploration, run bash scripts below:

```sh
pyenv install {version}
pyenv virtualenv -p python{3.x} {version} lab_flask
pyenv local lab_flask
```

A basic example of HTTP Verbs:

| POST | receive data, and use it | POST /item |
| PUT | make sure something is there | PUT /item |
| DELETE | remove something | DELETE /item/1 |
